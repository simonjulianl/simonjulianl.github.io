I was the member of the team for 2020-2021 and am the team lead for 2021-2022 term.\nFor current release 1.0, please check pinusonline.org\nAlso, keep a look out for more features that are going to be released in the future !\nBoNUS Working with Amadeus Aristo Winarto to develop a mobile app prototype using Next.js, Firebase, Sequelize and many other technology stacks aiming to revamp the current NUS facilities booking system (Rebok) that has outdated UI/UX and is not mobile-friendly.\nThis project is done to fulfill CP2106 Independent Software Development, Orbital (Apollo) and that is an avenue for us to also learn various tech stacks including cypress, postman testing, AWS S3 Buckets, AWS RDS and CircleCI.\nTo play with our app, please visit BoNUS (by the way, please open it using your phone and please contact me to get the admin account) !\nRaffles Hall Developer Since I like software development and I need points to stay in Raffles Hall (even though finally I don’t have enough points LMAO but no regrets), I was part of Raffles Hall Developer.\nAs the lead back-end developer for the second semester, I supervise the team to create the server for Raffles Hall Application using Flask and MongoDB.\nNot only that, I was in charge of the laundry machine feature too and worked with Redux and React.js for the front-end (even though its eventually rolled back because its ineffective).\nTo use the app, please visit rhapp.lol!\nSource Academy Drone Developer My first time trying out drone development with Arya Nagatama Giat, this project aims to have a programmable drone in Source Language that is used in CS1101S at NUS.\nWe use CoDrone which comes with the CoDrone library that is written in C and ported it into Source language using Sinter, which is Source VM Language for microcontroller.\nUnfortunately, we were unable to integrate it with the Source Front-End web client yet. This is done for CP3108 module.\nFor the demo video, check this out!\n",

<p>I participated in the Sea Labs summer internship program as an Android Engineer intern for the <a href="https://seatalk.io/">SeaTalk</a> team in Singapore and mentored by one of the full-timer, Zhao Jingyi.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my first time to work as a &ldquo;real&rdquo; software engineer (because I&rsquo;m an intern, but the intern at Sea gets almost the same treatment as full-time employee including code review, code testing with QA, communicating the requirements with PM, etc)</p>
<p>Initially, I was assigned with an entry task and working on two main projects, namely improving the qr code scanner by creating an Android view library using Google&rsquo;s ML-Kit library and support media viewer for videos.</p>
<p>I was also given the chance to maintain the technical documentation for the features using tools such as sequence diagram, state diagram, and UML diagram provided by PlantUML in the company&rsquo;s confluence page.</p>
<p>Lastly, as part of continuous learning (yes it&rsquo;s real peeps), I presented AppSearch library during SEA Android team sharing meeting!</p>
<h2 id="bioinformatics-institute-astar">Bioinformatics Institute, A*STAR<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#bioinformatics-institute-astar">#</a></h2>
<p>My first time going to an internship, especially being involved with Research and also thanks to Phuc Cuong Ngo and Amadeus Aristo Winarto that also went to the internship and introduced me to this project.</p>
<p>Being more inclined towards physics (since I took H3 Modern Physics PC1144 before), I experimented with physics-guided neural networks to solve the Fokker-Planck equation.</p>
<p>Not only that, I also help with the Hausdorff Dimension and FenceGAN (even though not much)</p>
<h2 id="pinus-tech">PINUS Tech<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pinus-tech">#</a></h2>
<p>A web application by PINUS Tech team built using Next.js and Sequelize that provides a guide for Indonesian freshmen and a platform to showcase Indonesian students’ activities at NUS. I was the member of the team for 2020-2021 and am the team lead for 2021-2022 term.</p>
<p>For current release 1.0, please check <a href="https://pinusonline.org">pinusonline.org</a></p>
<p>Also, keep a look out for more features that are going to be released in the future !</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/pinus.png" alt="PINUS"  />

<h2 id="bonus">BoNUS<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#bonus">#</a></h2>
<p><img src="/images/bonus.png" alt="drawing" height="350" style="float: left;margin:10px 10px 0px 0px;"/> Working with Amadeus Aristo Winarto to develop a mobile app prototype using Next.js, Firebase, Sequelize and many other technology stacks aiming to revamp the current NUS facilities booking system (Rebok) that has outdated UI/UX and is not mobile-friendly.</p>
<p>This project is done to fulfill CP2106 Independent Software Development, Orbital (Apollo) and that is an avenue for us to also learn various tech stacks including cypress, postman testing, AWS S3 Buckets, AWS RDS and CircleCI.</p>
<p>To play with our app, please visit <a href="https://bonus.vercel.app">BoNUS</a> (by the way, please open it using your phone and please contact me to get the admin account) !</p>
<h2 id="raffles-hall-developer">Raffles Hall Developer<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#raffles-hall-developer">#</a></h2>
<p>Since I like software development and I need points to stay in Raffles Hall (even though finally I don&rsquo;t have enough points LMAO but no regrets), I was part of Raffles Hall Developer.</p>
<p>As the lead back-end developer for the second semester, I supervise the team to create the server for Raffles Hall Application using Flask and MongoDB.</p>
<p>Not only that, I was in charge of the laundry machine feature too and worked with Redux and React.js for the front-end (even though its eventually rolled back because its ineffective).</p>
<p>To use the app, please visit <a href="https://rhapp.lol">rhapp.lol!</a></p>
<h2 id="source-academy-drone-developer">Source Academy Drone Developer<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#source-academy-drone-developer">#</a></h2>
<p>My first time trying out drone development with Arya Nagatama Giat, this project aims to have a programmable drone in Source Language that is used in CS1101S at NUS.</p>
<p>We use CoDrone which comes with the CoDrone library that is written in C and ported it into Source language using Sinter, which is Source VM Language for microcontroller.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we were unable to integrate it with the Source Front-End web client yet. This is done for CP3108 module.</p>
