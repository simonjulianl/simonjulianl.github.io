[{"content":"Functional Expressionism This questions are available as a quest for CS1101S module at NUS. While I do not create or modify any of the questions, here are just some of my thoughts on the shortcut how to solve the questions!\n but this doesn\u0026rsquo;t offer full explanation how the functions work or how the substitution model can be utilized here\n Anyway, here are some tips when you are solving these questions :\n Be vigilant, there are tons of hints being thrown at you and actually you can use them Try to understand the big idea, sometimes trying to subbing in the function one by one especially for the complex functions just leads you to one hell of a mess You can brute force, it\u0026rsquo;s fine and maybe you can try to work backward to understand why your brute force solutions work / doesn\u0026rsquo;t work  So, here are my insights on these questions!\n1. Increment Repeater You are given these functions and you are required to implement the increment_repeater,\nconst twice = (f) =\u0026gt; (x) =\u0026gt; f(f(x)); const thrice = increment_repeater(twice); const fourtimes = increment_repeater(thrice); const warn = thrice(display); warn(\u0026#34;ALERT\u0026#34;); // should display \u0026#34;ALERT\u0026#34; // three times in orange const bigwarn = fourtimes(display); bigwarn(\u0026#34;A L E R T\u0026#34;); // should display \u0026#34;A L E R T\u0026#34; // four times in orange // (the REPL will display // \u0026#34;A L E R T\u0026#34;a fifth time // [in white] as the value // returned by bigwarn) Actually, this already serves as a very big hint. First of all, we want to specify how the increment_repeater behaves. increment_repeater is a function that takes in a repeater and return another repeater, in another way =\u0026gt; increment_repeater : repeater -\u0026gt; repeater.\nNow, what is a repeater actually, it is a function that takes in f which is a function and x which is the argument with currying method, but overall it must be in the form of f =\u0026gt; x =\u0026gt; \u0026lt;do some useful work\u0026gt;.\nTherefore, we can firstly write\nconst increment_repeater = repeater =\u0026gt; (another repeater); ---- const increment_repeater = repeater =\u0026gt; f =\u0026gt; x =\u0026gt; \u0026lt;some useful work\u0026gt;; So given a repeater function that can repeat f N times, how do we repeat it one more time ? We can apply f 1 more time!, so to apply original repeater, we can do repeater(f)(x) and to add it one more time, we can do f(repeater(f)(x)) because f is a function!\nTherefore, the overall answer is\n// Answer :\rconst increment_repeater = repeater =\u0026gt; f =\u0026gt; x =\u0026gt; f(repeater(f)(x));\r2. Pair You are given a pair, which is defined using a function! Isn\u0026rsquo;t this amazing? Also, you are required to extract the head and the tail using another function and I think to be honest this is really amazing for me when I saw it for the first time, given a function can be used like this!\nFirstly, let\u0026rsquo;s understand what does pair do! pair is just a function that returns another function that accepts a new function which can be applied to the first 2 arguments being supplied or\n pair: (T, T) -\u0026gt; ( ((T, T) -\u0026gt; S) -\u0026gt; S)\n What this means is that, the returned result of pair would take in a function! We can use pair(1, 2)((x, y) =\u0026gt; x) to extract the head, but since we are given the syntax head(pair(1,2)), then we just need to assign a parameter to achieve the aforementioned effect, so\n// Answer const head = (theReturnedPair) =\u0026gt; theReturnedPair((x, y) =\u0026gt; x); Similarly for tail, you can try it out as an exercise!\n3. Omega Okay, you are given this function\nconst zero_repeater = (f) =\u0026gt; (x) =\u0026gt; x; const decrement_repeater = (repeater) =\u0026gt; head( repeater((p) =\u0026gt; pair(tail(p), increment_repeater(tail(p))))( pair(zero_repeater, zero_repeater) ) ); const twice = (f) =\u0026gt; (x) =\u0026gt; f(f(x)); const thrice = increment_repeater(twice); const also_twice = decrement_repeater(thrice); and no choice, you have to understand this function to give the time complexity lower bound\u0026hellip; You can try to trace the function for twice and see how it decrements to one repeater, or try once which is just const once = f =\u0026gt; x =\u0026gt; f(x);, but the idea here eventually is that you start from zero_repeater, and what each step does is that it will take the previous tail and set it as the head, and increment the previous tail as set it as the current tail, so\n// repeat twice\r0. 0, 0 // first\r1. 0, 1 // put tail of first -\u0026gt; head of new pair, increment tail of first -\u0026gt; tail of new pair\r2. 1, 2 // put tail of (1.) at head, increment tail of (1.) and put at tail\r// then extract the head which is 1 repeater now\rTherefore this program runs in Ω(n);\n4. Harder increment repeater and add repeaters The given codes here already serve as a very major hint\nconst zero_repeater = (f) =\u0026gt; (x) =\u0026gt; x; const one_repeater = (f) =\u0026gt; (x) =\u0026gt; f(zero_repeater, () =\u0026gt; zero_repeater(f)(x)); const two_repeater = (f) =\u0026gt; (x) =\u0026gt; f(one_repeater, () =\u0026gt; one_repeater(f)(x)); const three_repeater = (f) =\u0026gt; (x) =\u0026gt; f(two_repeater, () =\u0026gt; two_repeater(f)(x)); If you realize the pattern, const one_repeater = f =\u0026gt; x =\u0026gt; f(prev_repeater, () =\u0026gt; prev_repeater(f)(x)) and by following this pattern, you can finish increment_repeater pretty easily\n//Answer const increment_repeater = (prevRepeater) =\u0026gt; (f) =\u0026gt; (x) =\u0026gt; f(prevRepeater, () =\u0026gt; prevRepeater(f)(x)); And yeah, just be vigilant!\nThe second part, is harder because you can\u0026rsquo;t directly copy it, but the idea is you want to increment repeater1 by repeater2 times so you get repeater1 + repeater2 and thats why you need increment_repeater! From the previous part, you are given the way to use the repeater\n const to_int = repeater =\u0026gt; repeater((iter_count, x) =\u0026gt; x() + 1)(0);\n Therefore, you can try to copy how the repeater is applied, here to add 1, we apply x() and +1 so if we want to increment repeater, we also apply x() and then increment it because in this case if the initial value is given as a repeater, x() will give you a repeater too, which is the same as if the initial value is 0 (Number), x() will give you a number too! Hence you can add 1 to it! Therefore the answer is :\nconst add_repeaters = (repeater1, repeater2) =\u0026gt; repeater2((iter_count, x) =\u0026gt; increment_repeater(x()))(repeater1); And yeah, iter_count is useless here\u0026hellip;\n5. Decrement repeater Here we want to decrement the repeater, and given the pattern before\n const nextRepeater = f =\u0026gt; x =\u0026gt; f(prevRepeater, () =\u0026gt; prevRepeater(f)(x))\n One thing that we can do is to extract the head! Here is where iter_count can be useful! But the big question is that of course how to extract the head ?\nSimilar like head function, remember that f takes two arguments, and you can do whatever you want with those two arguments, hence you can write it as\nconst decrement_repeater = (repeater) =\u0026gt; repeater((iter_count, x) =\u0026gt; iter_count)(uselessStuff); This will work because (iter_count, x) =\u0026gt; iter_count acts like for the f, and uselessStuff here acts like the x which from the repeater, you can see we are just interested in the first argument and not the second so its useless until this point!\nHowever, for zero_repeater, this would return you an error because zero_repeater would just return x and if you don\u0026rsquo;t return a repeater, you will have your to_int broken!\nTherefore, for zero_repeater, you just pass zero_repeater as the x itself! MIND BLOWN!! So the final answer is\nconst decrement_repeater = (repeater) =\u0026gt; repeater((iter_count, x) =\u0026gt; iter_count)(zero_repeater); That\u0026rsquo;s all for this quest! pretty fun quest tbh!\n","permalink":"https://simonjulianl.github.io/post/cs1101sfunctionalquest/","summary":"Functional Expressionism This questions are available as a quest for CS1101S module at NUS.
